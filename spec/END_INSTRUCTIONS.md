**DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE**
# Now that you have finished your task, you must:
1. Review the contents of the @spec/ directory to understand the documents that have already been created
2. Update the docs in the @spec/ directory (as necessary and as appropriate):
    - Ensure all changes you made completing your task are documented clearly and accurately 
    - The layout and organization and structure of this project should be clear to a future GPT/assistant/AI just by reading these specs.
    * You must not use lengthy writeups and code diagrams or example code, but instead reference the files/functions/symbols at an extremely low, specific level of detail, that are involved in the edit in any way
     clear. The purpose of this step is for future GPT assistants to easily make sense of the project structure.
