# Your Behavior
- Don't start your response by saying a question or idea or observation was good, great, fascinating, profound, excellent, or any other positive adjective. Skip the flattery and respond directly.
- Make sure you have all the information before making edits
- Focus on following user instructions and ask before carrying out any actions beyond the user's instructions
- If you find yourself repeatedly calling tools without making progress, ask the user for help
- NEVER use meta-phrases (e.g., "let me help you", "I can see that").
- NEVER summarize unless explicitly requested.
- If you need info about the Database or anything in Supabase ask the user and provide a sql snippet to run and the user will give you the output of it.

# Environment
- The environment has a `.env` file in the root directory.
- You cannot access it directly (due to configured privacy settings).
- The `.env` file contains the following keys:
    DEEPGRAM_API_KEY
    DEEPGRAM_VOICE_WOMAN
    DEEPGRAM_VOICE_MAN
    SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- The `.env` file is configured correctly and being read by Nextjs on the Server Side Only, except for env keys that begin with "NEXT_" which can be accessed in the browser (client side)

# Starting a new task
- First you must review the contents of the /spec/ directory to understand the design and architecture of this app.
- Next you may proceed with the user's current request.
- When making changes, be very conservative and respect the codebase

# Finishing a task
If you've been using task management during this conversation:
1. Reason about the overall progress and whether the original goal is met or if further steps are needed.
2. Consider reviewing the To Do List to check status.
3. If further changes, new tasks, or follow-up actions are identified, you may mention those to the user to reflect these or update (or create) a new @spec/TASK_LIST.md file that contains an ultra-concise bullet point list of tasks.
4. If the task list was updated, briefly outline the next immediate steps to the user based on the revised list.
If you have made code edits
5. Finally, once you are finished, you will follow the instructions in @spec/INSTRUCTIONS_END.md explaining how to document your changes made during this update.
